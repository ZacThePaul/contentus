<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>For a long while now I've been interested in building a blog in Vanilla PHP with no frameworks.</p>

<p>Start XAMPP</p>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>All requests are passed through index.php, where they are handled by methods from the 
Router class.

<h2>Plans</h2>
<p>

Include Analytics out of the box.
